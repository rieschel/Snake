# SNAKE
The project is to make a version of the classic game snake in java. 

The player controls a square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. The snake grows when it eats fruit. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, a trail or other obstacle, or itself.
